The google drive folder is here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ou1mVgbzP9G2dHwDrvZwcze_SSuf9UBu?usp=sharing

Within the google drive folder are three models with the extension '.h5'. These are the three optimized models, you can load them in google colab
after connecting / mounting google colab and downloading the folder and uploading it to your google drive (if that's the way to do it).
Or simply modify the code to be able to load in the model. You will also find alongside the models, .data files and those are important too.
Read the 'data.txt' file in this directory for more information.

The model for CIFAR-10 data analysis is named as 'my_model_2.h5'

The model for the Spam Data Analysis is 'spambase_model_2.h5'

The model for Communities & Crime Data Analysis is 'model_crime_2.h5'
